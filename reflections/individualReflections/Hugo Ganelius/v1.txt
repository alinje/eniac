Denna råkade bli på engelska för jag glömde att ställa om hjärnan. Framtida blir på svenska.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
	I want to become more proficient and confident using git, 
	and I wish to improve my understanding of how software projects 
	fit together regarding different modules and external libraries.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	The easiest way would probably be to explain and thoroughly
	document my code to them, allowing them to learn whatever tricks
	I've used to accomplish my code. Also to walk them through how
	I would solve a problem that they're struggling with.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	So far, I have participated in setting up a scrum board. I hope 
	to be able to contribute to an active use of Scrum in the team, 
	as a previous project saw my group mostly ignoring it. I think 
	the best way to do this is by actiely using the Scrum board and 
	following the proper procedures, as well as encouraging my team
	to do the same.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	As we have not begun work on the project itself, there is 
	currently nothing to brag about. I think my responsibilities
	will lie mostly on the "model" side of things code-wise, as 
	this is where I feel the most confident. I hope I will get
	the opportunity to work with existing frameworks and on the 
	connections between different modules in the program, and that 
	I can learn from doing so.
