-What do I want to learn or understand better?
	I want to learn how to write better, especially since I'm going to be the next meeting secretary.

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I guess I could have like an advisory role when people are working.
	Or just emotional support, I don't know I'm drawing a blank here. Same thing as last week, I can't think of anything

-What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I've participated in meetings and discussions and kept up with deadlines, although I did almost miss a meeting because I overslept.

-What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I completed my task for this week, I think...?
