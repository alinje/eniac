Alcur is a hedge fund that deals in trading and betting on the stock market. Currently, all of Alcur's stocks and bets are tracked in a single Excel document. This makes it difficult to get a comprehensive overview.Â 

The goal of our project is to create a program that can be used by Alcur to more easily understand the stock they hold, by use of features such as user-defined tags for stocks, filters, statistics, and graphs. The hope is that this will allow for for more efficient decision making and better trades/bets.
